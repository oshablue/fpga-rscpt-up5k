# SG48 Package: for UltraPlus
# From Pin 1 designation:
# LHS: Pins 1 - 12
# Bottom: Pins 13 - 24
# RHS: Pins 25 - 36
# Top: Pins 37 - 48 (going right to left of course)
# PIOT_xx means "Top" and these are Bank 0
# PIOB_xx means "Bottom" and these are:
#         xx <= 9: Bank 2
#         xx > 9:  Bank 1
# RGBs are Bank O
# IOT/B_Gx means one of 6 global input buses, if that is selected as a function
#          such as clock input, reset net etc.

#
# Caution: These pin names/mappings have not been double-checked yet!!!
#


#
# Implementation:
# Bank2: 8-bits data capture data_in[] real pin#s: 44-48, 2-4
# Bank0: IO pins within real pin #s: 26 - 36 for data_out[] and comms out
#        control incl rxd / txd (real pin#s 23 - 25)
# Reset should go to a global net - use: G1 or G3 available
# Clock In (16MHz) should go to a global net - use: G1 or G3 available
# The Lattice Dev Kit for UP5K datasheet: Nice part in schematic showing
# the organization of the pinout for bank and layout purposes.
# Also see the ADC and comm FTDI chip pinouts for bit organization and pin maps
# Although yes of course pins can be remapped (mostly so here) for routing purposes
